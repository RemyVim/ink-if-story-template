Welcome, storyteller!

So you're thinking about using [Ink](www.inklestudios.com/ink/) for your interactive fiction? Excellent choice. And you've found this template to go with it? Even better.

Here's what this template adds to your Ink stories:

> Complete save/load system with file import/export
> Easy text formatting using a markdown-esque system
> Reader-friendly theme and accessibility features
> Special reference pages (character sheets, maps, etc.)
> Easy image, audio, and background additions
> Looks great on phones, tablets, and computers
> Graceful error recovery when things go wrong

Ready to see how easy this is? Every feature you're about to experience will often take less than a line in your Ink script.
