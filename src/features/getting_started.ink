: Getting Started Guide

Using this template is straightforward:

:: The Process
1. __Write__ your story in ink (like this demo)
2. __Compile__ it to JSON using Inky or inklecate  
3. __Replace__ the `story.json` file in the template
4. __Customize__ the CSS if desired (optional)
5. __Deploy__ anywhere that serves static files

This template uses vanilla JavaScript - no npm, webpack, or any complex tooling needed.

Just write, compile, and deploy.
