: Getting Started Guide

Using this template is straightforward:

:: The Process
1. __Get the template__ from [GitHub](github.com/RemyVim/ink-if-story-template)
2. __Write__ your story in Ink (like this demo)
3. __Compile__ it to JSON using Inky or inklecate  
4. __Replace__ the `story.json` file in the template
5. __Customize__ the CSS if desired (optional)
6. __Deploy__ anywhere that serves static files

This template uses vanilla JavaScript - no npm, webpack, or any complex tooling needed. Just write, compile, and deploy.

Happy writing!
