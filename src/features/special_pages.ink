: Special Pages System

You can create optional pages that automatically appear in the navigation:

:: Available Special Pages
> `about` - Information about your story
> `credits` - Acknowledgments and credits
> `content_warnings` - Content notes for readers
> `stats_page` - Character statistics
> `inventory` - Player inventory
> `help` - Instructions for players

:: How It Works
Just create a knot with one of these names, and the template automatically:
> Shows the navigation button
> Handles the page display
> Provides a return-to-story button

:: This Demo Has Examples
Check the navigation bar - you'll see "about" and "credits" buttons because this demo includes those knots.
