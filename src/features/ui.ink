: Navigation and Interface

Notice the top navigation bar? It automatically provides:
> __Restart/save/load__ buttons

On mobile devices, the navigation stacks vertically for easy touch access.

> Save/load system works out of the box
> Theme switching between light and dark modes  
> Mobile-friendly responsive layout
> No configuration required
