## Why This Template?

Ink is a fantastic scripting language for interactive fiction, but getting your story onto the web shouldn't require wrestling with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This template handles all of that so you can focus on writing.

Everything works through simple Ink tags like this:

```ink
# IMAGE: tavern.jpg
# AUDIO: door-creak.mp3
# ACHIEVEMENT: You found a secret!
```
