# Keyboard Shortcuts Reference

Navigate and interact with your story using keyboard shortcuts. These work automatically—no setup required.

## Quick Reference

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `1` - `9` | Select choice 1-9 |
| `A` - `Z` | Select choice 10+ (A=10, B=11, etc.) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Scroll up/down (small - ~15% of the screen height) |
| `Page Up` / `Page Down` | Scroll up/down (large - ~80% of the screen height) |
| `Home` / `End` | Jump to top/bottom |
| `Ctrl+S` | Open save menu |
| `Ctrl+R` | Restart story |
| `Ctrl+,` | Open settings |
| `Ctrl+h` | Open keyboard shortcut reference panel |
| `Esc` | Close menu / Return to story |

## Notes

- Shortcuts are disabled when typing in input fields
- Scrolling/choice shortcuts are disabled when a modal (save menu, settings) is open
- On Mac, use `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`

## Disabling Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts can be disabled in **Settings → Accessibility → Enable Keyboard Shortcuts**.

This is useful for:

- Screen reader users, where shortcuts like `1`, `2`, `A`, `B` may conflict with the reader's own navigation
- Users who prefer to navigate purely by mouse or touch
- Situations where accidental key presses cause unwanted choice selections

When disabled, all keyboard shortcuts (choice selection, scrolling, menu shortcuts) are turned off.

> **Note:** Keyboard shortcuts are automatically disabled on mobile/touch-only devices.
