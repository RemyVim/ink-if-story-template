This guide will cover different ways to run a local server for testing your story, including Python, VS Code Live Server, and other options.

In the meantime, you can publish directly to [itch.io](https://itch.io) or [Neocities](https://neocities.org) to preview your story. See the [Quick Start](../quickstart.md).
