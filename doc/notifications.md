# Notifications

Show messages to players without interrupting the story flow. Notifications appear briefly in the corner and fade away automatically.

```ink
# NOTIFICATION: You found a secret passage.
# ACHIEVEMENT: Quest Complete!
# WARNING: Your health is low.
# ERROR: Something went wrong.
```

## When to Use Each Type

| Type | Use For | Duration |
|------|---------|----------|
| `NOTIFICATION` | General info, discoveries, hints | Short |
| `ACHIEVEMENT` | Milestones, unlocks, successes | Longer (more celebratory) |
| `WARNING` | Low resources, danger ahead, caution | Short |
| `ERROR` | Something went wrong (rare in stories) | Short |

All types are purely visual: they don't affect gameplay.

Achievements might be linked to an actual achievement system in the future.
