# Audio

Add sound effects and background music to enhance your story's atmosphere.

## Sound Effects

Play a sound once when the text appears:

```ink
# AUDIO: assets/sword-clang.mp3
```

Great for: door creaks, footsteps, notifications, dramatic moments.

## Background Music

Loop music continuously:

```ink
# AUDIOLOOP: assets/tavern-music.mp3
```

To stop the music:

```ink
# AUDIOLOOP: none
```

## Tips

- **Supported formats:** MP3 works everywhere. OGG and WAV also work in most browsers.
- **File location:** Put audio files in `build/assets/`. (Not required, all paths are relative to the build directory, but it keeps everything organized!)
- **Reader control:** Players can mute all audio in the Settings menu.
